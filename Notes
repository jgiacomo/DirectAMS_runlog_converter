These are my notes on this project.

The exportDFtoAcciumRunlog.R script requires that the other lab's runlog is
already in a data.frame format. However, I believe it would not be difficult to
modify this so that it would read in the other lab's runlog, identify the
column widths, identify the column names, then read it in as a data.frame. Then,
it would pull all colomns matching those used in Accium runlogs and fill in 0
for all columns expected by Accium runlogs and not included in the other lab's
runlog. This would allow a new runlog to be built that matched Accium's.

Also, currently, to identify the column widths and names of an Accium runlog,
the program actually reads in an Accium runlog. I think I will just save the
column width and names objects as RDS files that can be read in by the program.
That should be easier and faster than reading in a runlog and identifying column
information everytime the program runs.

Then, all of this will be put into a Shiny app that will allow the user to
upload the other lab's runlog, view, and then download a new Accium formatted
runlog. This will allow direct input into CRABS as long as all necessary columns
for CRABS to run are included.
